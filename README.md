This is the backend for Wazimap-NG.

# Introduction

Wazimap-NG is the next version of [Wazimap](http://www.wazimap.co.za). It provides a platform for users to bind tabular data to spatial boundaries in order create curated views of datasets. Yes - that's probably too vague a description to understand what it is. Hopefully the images below provide a better description:

You can find the backend code in this repository. The frontend is available here: [https://github.com/openupsa/wazimap-ng-ui](https://github.com/openupsa/wazimap-ng-ui).

# New features

The main new features are:

* Admins now have more flexibility when it comes to loading data. This includes uploading massive datasets and then slicing and dicing in the backend rather than pre-preparing datasets beforehand.
* Point data is now fully integrated as a first-class spatial object. 
* Choropleths built into the main view. These were hidden behind multiple clicks in the previous version.
* One platform can host multiple profiles off the same database.
* The Rich data view allows richer disaggregation of indicators.
* The administrator can configure the view to use custom basemaps, colours, and other UI settings.
* Arbitrary spatial boundaries and hierarchies can be loaded onto the same server.
* Toggling of overlapping boundary layers such as switching between wards and mainplaces which typically cover the same areas.
* Integration into third-party data sources for realtime data feeds.

# Related software
There is no shortage of mapping software available, both commerical and open-source. Wazimap focuses on providing a platform for data custodians to showcase their datasets and mashing them up with public data. The most similar tool that we have found is the excellent [GeoNode](https://geonode.org/). We feel that approach to publishing data is significantly different enough to warrant a separate project.

# Roadmap
Version 0.8 is due soon and will fix bugs that currently don't have workarounds. We'll publish the 1.0 roadmap soon.

# Future features
* WFS endpoint for publishing data to other GIS software
* Pluggable data visualisations
* Better handling of geography hierarchies.
* Improved handling of temporal and other types of non-census-like data.
* Speed improvements
* A large standard database of public datasets.

# Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

# Local Development

Local development is normally done inside docker-compose so that the supporting services are available and the environment is very similar to how the application is run in production.

Make docker-compose start the supporting services using

    docker-compose run --rm web python wait_for_postgres.py
      
Run the tests using

    docker-compose run --rm -e DJANGO_CONFIGURATION=Test web pytest /app/tests
    
Start the backend using 

    docker-compose up
    
Run Django manage commands inside docker-compose, e.g. create a superuser:

    docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser


# Documentation
These are works in progress:

* [Technical manual](https://openup.gitbook.io/wazi-ng-technical/)
* [Administrator manual](https://openup.gitbook.io/wazimap-ng/)

# Contributions
Contributions are welcome - we are working towards making this process easier. New development takes place in the [staging branch](https://github.com/OpenUpSA/wazimap-ng/tree/staging)


# Shoulders of giants
This project is the next iteration of a number of excellent projects starting with [CensusReporter](https://censusreporter.org/) and [Wazimap](http://www.wazimap.co.za) that followed it. Special thanks to William Bird from [Media Monitoring Africa](https://mediamonitoringafrica.org) whose initial idea (and funding) it was to build a tool to help journalists better understand areas they were reporting on. Also thanks to Chris Berens from [VPUU](vpuu.org.za) who directed funding to help kickstart this new build. Finally, all of the amazing spatial software and tools developed by one of the most dedicated open source communities out there.
